# PrefabSystem w-PrototypePattern

Hey!
I am OÄŸuzhan and I have been working in various fields as a software developer for over 4 years.

In this project, I wanted to make an example for the patrol system prepared with State Pattern. You can also find an example for Singleton Pattern in the project. I hope it was understandable and educational.
